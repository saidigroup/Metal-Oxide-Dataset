# Metal-Oxide-Dataset
Supporting Data for the Metal Oxide MLP


For bulk potentials the directory structure is:<br>
[iteration #] -- [Materials Project Structure ID] -- [cell size] -- [temperature in Kelvin] <br>
<br>
The surface, additional structure, and thermal expansion dataset are meant to be combined with the bulk potential, hence the iteration number continues from the bulk.<br>
<br>
The surface dataset directory structure is: <br>
[iteration #] -- [surface orientation] -- [surface thickness] -- [surface area] -- [temperature in Kelvin] <br>
<br>
The thermal expansion dataset directory structure is: <br>
[iteration #] -- [% lattice expansion/contraction] -- [temperature in Kelvin]
