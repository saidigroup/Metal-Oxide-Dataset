# Metal-Oxide-Dataset
Supporting Data for the Metal Oxide MLP


For bulk potentials the directory structure is:
[iteration #] -- [Materials Project Structure ID] -- [cell size] -- [temperature in Kelvin]

The surface, additional structure, and thermal expansion dataset are meant to be combined with the bulk potential, hence the iteration number continues from the bulk.

The surface dataset directory structure is: 
[iteration #] -- [surface orientation] -- [surface thickness] -- [surface area] -- [temperature in Kelvin]

The thermal expansion dataset directory structure is:
[iteration #] -- [% lattice expansion/contraction] -- [temperature in Kelvin]
